# Crafted Experiment

This repository contains the code for generating crafted datasets based on real scRNA-seq data. In [our study](), we generated 24 crafted datasets via perturbing genes selected from different levels of sparsity based on the previously published 3 cell line mixture dataset from [GEO: GSE136148](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE136148).
