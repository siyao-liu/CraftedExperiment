## Description

All 24 crafted datasets generated in the paper are included in the `crafted_datasets_paper` folder:

- `Sparse_AddPois0.5_crafteddata.rds`: A list contains crafted datasets generated by crafting genes in the sparse region via adding counts modeled by the Poisson distribution with a parameter of 0.5 to the original counts for the selected crafted luminal cells.

- `Medium_AddCount2_craftedata.rds`: A list contains crafted datasets generated by crafting genes in the medium region via adding a count of 2 to the original counts for the selected luminal cells.
  
- `Medium_AddPois1.5_craftedata.rds`: A list contains crafted datasets generated by crafting genes in the medium region via adding counts modeled by the Poisson distribution with a parameter of 1.5 to the original counts for the selected luminal cells.
  
- `Medium_AddPoisF3_craftedata.rds`: A list contains crafted datasets generated by crafting genes in the medium region via adding counts modeled by the Poisson distribution with a parameter taken to be the original count multiplied by 3 to the original counts for the selected luminal cells.
  
- `Dense_AddCount10_crafteddata.rds`: A list contains crafted datasets generated by crafting genes in the dense region via adding a count of 10 to the original counts for the selected luminal cells.
  
- `Dense_AddPoisF1.5_crafteddata.rds`: A list contains crafted datasets generated by crafting genes in the dense region via adding counts modeled by the Poisson distribution with a parameter taken to be the original count multiplied by 1.5 to the original counts for the selected crafted luminal cells.
